Features:
When working with functions in JavaScript, it is important to understand the basic elements that make up a function. The function keyword is used to declare a function, and it indicates that what follows is a block of code that can be executed when called. The function name is the unique identifier used to refer to the function later in the code.

When the function is defined with a specific name, we can set up a function call at a later point in the program, and then it will execute the block of code that is bound to that name. A function call consists of the function name followed by parentheses, and possibly arguments that the function needs to perform the task. A "call" can be made several times in the code, which makes functions very useful to avoid repetition of code and to organize the program in a more structured way.

By using functions in this way, you can break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, which can be reused in multiple places in the program, making your code more modular, easier to debug, and more efficient.

JUDGMENT Manipulation:
Web developers work quite a bit with what is DOMM (Document Object Model Manipulation), a representation of the structure of HTML documents as a tree of objects. Each HTML element is represented as an object in the DOM tree, and these objects can be manipulated using JavaScript to dynamically change the content, style, or structure of a web page.

By manipulating the DOM, we can make our websites interactive and responsive to user actions. For example, we can use JavaScript to update text content by changing the text in a paragraph when a button is pressed. We can also change CSS styles dynamically, like changing the background color of a div when the mouse moves over it. In addition, we can add and remove HTML elements on the page in real time, such as showing or hiding an image when a user clicks a certain button.

During the course, the technique addEventListener was introduced, which is an important part of JavaScript programming when it comes to handling user interactions on websites. This method allows us to "listen" for specific events, such as a mouse click, keystroke, or changes to an HTML element, and then perform an action when those events occur. In this way we can add interactivity to a website.

Together with querySelector(), addEventListener() gives us the ability to retrieve specific elements from the HTML document and attach event handlers to them. querySelector() makes it easy to find items by id name. Once we have identified an element on the web page, we can use addEventListener to bind an event handler to this element, such as activating a function when a button is pressed.

Together, these two techniques create a powerful tool for building dynamic and interactive websites, where we can react to the user's actions and adapt
